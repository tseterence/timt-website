2/14/22 Notes:
- mobile-related:
    - slideshow not smooth on mobile when width = 100%
    - landscape responsiveness
    - idea: home and indiv proj page on mobile like instagram feed, followed by description (latter)
    - //decrease top margin in html pages
    - //increase project table width
    - //set z-index for header/footer in html pages
    
- fix arrow buttons for slideshow
- "navlink current" border when on individual proj page?
- proper superscript format in proj table "area" column


2/4/22 Notes:
- sort function in proj table header
- contact page: 1 empty space between each line. no space between email and phone#
- minify CSS/JS code? gzip?
- images courtesy of ____ & ____
- //show only two columns in Projects page for mobile (proj & year):

- //projects table: no space between rows; only 1 empty space between table header and content. clickable link on project row


1/21/22 notes:
- height of img within slideshow remains the same (ie positioning of caption and arrows don't move), see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47024703/restricting-slideshow-images-to-height-width-of-the-slideshow-container
- info page: between each line in single paragraph, 4px spacing. between each paragraph, one entire empty line
- clicking on image within proj page takes you to fullscreen of said image. within fullscreen, (invisible line) clicking on right-half takes you to next photo. left-half to previous photo. esc keydown or X button on top right to close out of fullscreen?
- // (manually done with vh) center text vertically within page only for Information and Contact pages
- //project list page, takes user to individual proj page
- //from home page, click on caption --> individual proj page
- //no hover feature at all
- //border box around current page
- //"information" --> clickable attached pdf for resume, opened in new tab (see https://apdesign.k-state.edu/about/faculty-staff/baudoin/)
