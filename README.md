- project list page, takes user to individual proj page
- from home page, click on caption --> individual proj page
- center text vertically within page
- info page: between each line in single paragraph, 4px spacing. between each paragraph, one entire empty line
- clicking on image takes you to fullscreen of said image. within fullscreen, (invisible line) clicking on right-half takes you to next photo. left-half to previous photo.
- height of img within slideshow remains the same (ie positioning of caption and arrows don't move)
- //no hover feature at all
- //border box around current page
- //"information" --> clickable attached pdf for resume, opened in new tab (see https://apdesign.k-state.edu/about/faculty-staff/baudoin/)
